        Hello, I'm Hasan Coskun, a creative junior Front-End Developer from Cologne, Germany.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moving on from my role as a chemical plant operator, I've always been fascinated by the software driving our processes. <br>
        This led me to experiment with building small apps in my free time. 
        Now, as a Junior Front-End Developer, I'm excited to combine my industrial background with coding expertise to create user-centered applications.
        <br>
        <br>
        Feel free to reach out and let's connect!
